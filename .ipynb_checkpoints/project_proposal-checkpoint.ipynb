    "In the world of tennis (and most sports), events and tournaments are divided into categories of males and females for fairness (excluding partnered matches). Therefore, female and male statistics are not usually compared in one group. However, there are many outstanding female players that could very well pose as serious competition to the male dominated sport - 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams is definitely one of them. Williams is ranked number 1 in international women's tennis, and started her professional career in her early teenage years, reflecting her exceptional skill and sportsmanship. This leads us to our question: How would top player Serena Williams rank amongst the top 500 male players? Our group intends to analyze the factors that separate men's and women's sports, and use them in a classification model to predict which category (intervals from 1 - 501 players) Williams would fall under if she were to partake in a men's only tournament. To conduct this analysis, we will be using the Player Stats for Top 500 players dataset, from  https://www.ultimatetennisstatistics.com/. We will be considering the factors of height, number of seasons played, and the age the player entered. This will allow us to examine whether physical stature serves as a male advantage or not, and otherwise compares skill level. Consequently, we will be creating categories using the \"best rank\" column to further sort our data and choose a new rank level for Serena. "
